# methinks it is like a weasel

Creation of a simple genetic algorithm in order to find the phrase "methinks it is like a weasel", with and without the use of crossover.

We measure speed in terms of the number of mutations which needed to take place to reach the solution. Given this, I found that a genetic algorithm with crossover performed better than without, often up to 4x better.
